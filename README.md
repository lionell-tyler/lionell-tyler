Howdy, I'm @lioneell-tyler 👋

I am a professional full-stack developer, and I ❤️ to code.

Consider myself great with spring-based applications especially rest api's. 
Used to write java code, but I am practicing kotlin right now, and it's really great.

Also trying to get better in front-end development. The node.js ecosystem is insane.
Currently practicing react.
